            </p>

            <p>For everyone who's been wondering about what's going on with school here's the full explanation.</p>
            <p>A lot of people know that I'm planning to change course, but I haven't really shared any details with anyone. I've been getting quite a few questions lately, so I figured it's time to open up.</p>
            <p>The truth is, I'm planning to leave my current school. I just don't fit into the system, and it's been wearing me down. I've never felt this stressed, and at the same time, so angry. It's affected me in ways I didn't expect I haven't been myself lately. I've been rude to friends, even to the point of cutting off contact with some people, and I've picked up some bad habits..</p>
            <p><b>So I've decided it's time for a big change.</b></p>
            <p>My current plan is to start a BBL study in the Netherlands. That means I'll be working four days a week as a junior software developer/engineer for a company, and going to school just one day a week. It sounds like the perfect setup for me: learning on the job, doing something I'm passionate about, and finally escaping a school system that doesn't work for me.</p>
            <p><b>But it also comes with big sacrifices.</b></p>
            <p>I'll be leaving my current school behind, and that means saying goodbye for now to the people I've known for years. I'll also have less contact with people my age, which is scary in itself. And the biggest change of all I'll be living with my grandfather during the week, only coming home on weekends. That part terrifies me, if I'm honest.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>I believe that in the end everything falls into place even if it takes some time</b>. And on that note I'll leave it here.</p>

            </p>
  
            <p>Just a quick update if you've noticed I've been a bit quiet the past few days, it's because I'm currently on holiday in England, exploring the beautiful Peak District I'll be here from April 16th to April 21st, enjoying some time away with my family.</p>
            <p>It's definitely nice to be out and about in nature, even though I'll admit I've been putting a bit of strain on my family. I've been under quite a bit of stress lately, and it's been affecting me more than I expected.</p>
            <p>When I get back, school starts up again, and I've got a tough couple of weeks ahead. I'm already feeling a bit stressed about it all but I'm trying to stay optimistic.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>I believe that in the end everything falls into place even if it takes some time</b>. And on that note id like to end.</p>

            <p>Today I created this blog on The Classic Web. It is a simple HTML page with a few blog posts.</p>
            <p>The process of creating this blog was both fun and educational. By using pure HTML and CSS, I was able to craft a lightweight and fast-loading website. This blog serves as a tribute to the early days of the internet, where creativity and simplicity were key.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to add new features and content to this blog. Thank you for visiting The Classic Web!</p>
