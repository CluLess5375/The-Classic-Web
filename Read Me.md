# Hello There,

**This is the fifth build of The Classic Web. 23 April 2025 1:50AM**

I added a **AOL** like loading screen for an even more *authentic* experience!

I also completely rewrote the whole *music* system so its more **portable**, **reliable** and allows for different playlist.

The general layout of the site changed a bit with a side bar to the right that houses the music player.

Added a Contact page and a construction page for the forms and the about page for now.
